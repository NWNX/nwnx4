/*
 * NWN2_JStar::SearchStep
 *
 * - There is a bug here somewhere where we return a NWN2_JStar::Node to the
 *   node allocator pool while it is still in use.  The way this typically
 *   fails is that we get a loop in the list because a node is inserted into
 *   the list twice after being freed and then checked out again for the same
 *   NWN2_JStar instance (failure mode I).  Other failure modes are possible
 *   (bizzare pathing behavior due to alias a "hot" NWN2_JStar::Node from
 *   another active NWN2_JStar instance (failure mode II), or taking a node in
 *   the free list and walking the free list ``Next'' pointers as
 *   NWN2_JStar::Node::m_pParent pointers until we reach the end of pool marker
 *   at 0xDEADBEEF (failure mode III).
 *
 * - N.B. I am considering instancing the allocator pool on a per-NWN2_JStar
 *   instance basis, disabling ``free'' calls, and then just throwing away the
 *   entire list of allocations made by that NWN2_JStar instance in the context
 *   of NWN2_JStar::~NWN2_JStar.  This should fix the problem for good at the
 *   cost of some minor additional memory usage while an NWN2_JStar instance is
 *   performing pathing stepping.  However, given the maximum pathing step
 *   length (300), this seems like it shouldn't be too much of an issue.
 *
 * - To find the actual problem, I recommend replacing the standard
 *   NWN2_MemPool< NWN2_JStar::Node > with a page heap style allocator that
 *   places each node on it's own page and reprotects that page to noaccess
 *   after it is freed to the pool.  This will catch the first use of a freed
 *   NWN2_JStar::Node object.  It may also be useful to log a stack trace with
 *   each allocation.  To use the system page heap to accomplish these tasks,
 *   simply replace NWN2_MemPool< NWN2_JStar::Node >::Free with HeapFree, and
 *   NWN2_MemPool< NWN2_JStar::Node >::Alloc with HeapAlloc, and enable page
 *   heap, which will also conveniently log stack traces as well NWN2 is
 *   rebuilt with /Oy- (so that EBP-based stack traces work).  Note that as
 *   Microsoft builds Windows with /Oy-, I believe that it would be a
 *   reasonable change to make for release builds for all modules, as it
 *   significantly improves debuggability of these issues in conjuction with
 *   tools such as page heap.
