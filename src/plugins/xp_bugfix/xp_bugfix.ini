#
# The GameObjUpdate burst size, or the maximum amount of data that can be sent

# GameObjUpdateBurstSize = 102400

#
# The server timer can be configured to use GetTickCount, which may be useful

#
# The GameObjUpdateTime, or interval at which the game state is re-synchronized
# to clients, can be configured here.  Increasing this value can significantly
# lower CPU utilization on the server, but can contribute to greater perceived
# latency for players, as clients are told of world updates less often.
#
# The default value, which is also the server's built-in default, is
# 200000 microseconds.  Values up to 400000 are often tolerable without too
# much perceived impact to players.  Values over 1000000 often significantly
# noticible to players.

# It is recommended that ReplaceNetLayer = 1 be used for this option, or area
# load times for players may be greatly impacted.

#
# The number of internal buffers used by the campaign database can be changed
# here.  Each buffer utiizes 32K of memory.  The server default scales based
# on available memory, but can be inordinately large on machines with 4GB of

#
# Directly poll for up to 50 packets each main loop iteration, used to fix
# issues where the server doesn't read from the network in a timely fashion

# Enable TLS.  Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 or better on the server,

#
# https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054530/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-offline-installer-for-windows
#
# This feature requires ReplaceNetLayer = 1 to be set to work.
#
# This feature is on by default.  If .NET Framework 4.7.2 or better is
# not installed then the feature will be disabled.
#
# Host keys require .NET Framework 4.7.2 to be automatically generated.  If a
# system has .NET Framework 4.7.0 and host keys are copied from another server,
# TLS will still work.
#
# A host key is automatically created in the NWNX4 installation
# directory, in the form of NWNCertificate.cer (public key) and
# NWNCertificate.pfx (public key + private key).  It is recommended
# to back these files up and use the same NWNCertificate.pfx for
# all server instances hosting the same module as clients associate
# TLS host keys with module resource names when strict TLS is
# enabled.  That is, all servers using the same autodownloader client side
# module directory should use use the same host key combination.
#
# TLS requires Client Extension 1.0.0.29 or better client-side.  Clients
# without the necessary support still work, just without TLS.
#
# Default is 1.

# out of sync about where the player's character is facing after WASD style

# Changes the AABB (bounding box) count allocated at startup for each area.
# If set to 0, the server default of 2000 is used.  This is more than most
# areas need and consumes a few MB of memory per area.  The xp_bugfix default
# if this value is not set is 100.

# stock server default is 16, which is too many for objcts that do not have
# any typical need for attachments, i.e. placed effects or environmental
# objects.  Furthermore, only client applications appear to use anything
# beyond the base attachment point, so it appears safe to set this value to
# 1, which will reduce the memory overhead of each game object.  The xp_bugfix
# default if this value is not set is 1.
